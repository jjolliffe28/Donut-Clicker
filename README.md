# Donut Clicker
## The Scenario - Welcome to Jack the Baker Baking Company!
You have been contracted by Fred the Baker Baking Company to take a concept, Donut Maker Clicker, from the drawing board to the browser. Jack the Baker is tired of making real donuts and is ready to retire. He needs our help to keep his love of donuts alive. Has hired you as an extra staff member to help make as many donuts he can each day!

### The Auto Clicker
The auto clicker can be bought with some donuts you make. The auto clicker will automatically click every second.
Every time you purchase an auto clicker they get 10% more expensive.

### The Click Multiplier
You start the game with 1 click = 1 donut. You can invest donuts into the click multiplier to get a 10% multiplier for each click!
Much like the auto clicker, the multipliers get more expensive with each multiplier bought.
